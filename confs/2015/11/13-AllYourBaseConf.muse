** PostgreSQL is YeSQL!

The database landscape has changed a lot in the recent years. The NoSQL
movement has taken the world by storm and you may wonder if there is still
room for relational databases. In this talk we will learn about the
strengths that make PostgreSQL more relevant than ever. Weâ€™ll survey its
architecture, availability tradeoffs, durability with one or more servers,
and yes even SQL!

** What Will I Learn?

From this talk you will learn to appreciate how versatile SQL really is and
the many use-cases it can be applied to and solve elegantly. You will also
be introduced to the basics for PostgreSQL High Availability and Scaling, a
must-know in this time of high availability.
