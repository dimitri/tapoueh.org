conference = "[PGCon](https://www.pgcon.org/2010/) is an annual conference for users and developers of PostgreSQL, a leading relational database, which just happens to be open source. PGCon is the place to meet, discuss, build relationships, learn valuable insights, and generally chat about the work you are doing with PostgreSQL. If you want to learn why so many people are moving to PostgreSQL, PGCon will be the place to find out why. Whether you are a casual user or you've been working with PostgreSQL for years, PGCon will have something for you."
summary = """**2 years of londiste** is a talk that summarize what we've found in this project after having been using it for 2 years in production. From the community aspects to the failure experience and the impact on the database management (rollouts, etc).

And the other presentation is a *Lightning Talk* about [pg_staging](https://github.com/dimitri/pg_staging), a tool that helps you setup and maintain your staging environments from your production backups!"""
