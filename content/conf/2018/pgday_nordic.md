conference = "[Nordic PGDay 2018](https://2018.nordicpgday.org) is an excellent chance to learn more about the worlds most advanced open source database among your peers in the Nordic region. Whether you use PostgreSQL professionally or play with it in your spare time; whether you love the new jsonb capabilities or hack on query planner internals; Nordic PGDay will have something for you."
summary = """As a developer using PostgreSQL one of the most important tasks you have to deal with is modeling the database schema for your application. In order to achieve a solid design, itâ€™s important to understand how the schema is then going to be used as well as the trade-offs it involves."""
