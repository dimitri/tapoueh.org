conference = "PGCon is an annual conference for users and developers of PostgreSQL, a leading relational database, which just happens to be open source. PGCon is the place to meet, discuss, build relationships, learn valuable insights, and generally chat about the work you are doing with PostgreSQL. If you want to learn why so many people are moving to PostgreSQL, PGCon will be the place to find out why. Whether you are a casual user or you've been working with PostgreSQL for years, PGCon will have something for you."
summary = """A talk about the then ongoing effort to implement support for **Extensions** in PostgreSQL. My patch was committed in 9.1 and is the basis for the `create extension` command."""
