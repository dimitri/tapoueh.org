summary = """As a developer using PostgreSQL one of the most important tasks you have to deal with is modeling the database schema for your application. In order to achieve a solid design, it’s important to understand how the schema is then going to be used as well as the trade-offs it involves.

As Fred Brooks said: “Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious.”

In this talk we're going to see practical normalisation examples and their benefits, and also review some anti-patterns and their typical PostgreSQL solutions, including Denormalization techniques thanks to advanced Data Types."""
