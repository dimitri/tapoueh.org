PostgreSQL is the World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database and by the end of this talk you will understand what that means for you, an application developer. What kind of problems PostgreSQL can solve for you, and how much you can rely on PostgreSQL in your daily activities, including unit-testing."""
