Sessions are curated to be a mix of practical, relatable and inspirational talks on a range of database technologies, established and new, with guaranteed actionable takeaways and solutions to your biggest bugbears."
summary = "The database landscape has changed a lot in the recent years. The NoSQL movement has taken the world by storm and you may wonder if there is still room for relational databases. In this talk we will learn about the strengths that make PostgreSQL more relevant than ever. Weâ€™ll survey its architecture, availability tradeoffs, durability with one or more servers, and yes even SQL!"
