conference = "[FOSDEM](https://archive.fosdem.org/2015/) is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels."
summary = """Backups are not interesting. Don't make backups. Instead, set-up an all automatic data restoring facility, that you can use in nightly scripts or interactively, when the worst happens. The first talk is about what happens when you're merely doing backups and the worst happens. 

The second talk is about [pgloader](http://pgloader.io) and how to migrate a full MySQL database to PostgreSQL using a single command line!"""
