summary = """**pgloader, your migration companion** <br/> Migrating data from another RDBMS to PostgreSQL should be really easy. After all it's all relations and tables and the same data types everywhere or abouts, with text, dates and numbers. Well it's actually quite messy and complex to migrate the data properly from one system to another. pgloader solves this problem and turns it into a one-liner: in this talk you'll learn how to benefit from that, and the classic pitfalls to avoid.
