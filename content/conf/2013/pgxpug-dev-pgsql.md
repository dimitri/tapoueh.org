conference = "[Portland Postgres Users Group](https://pdxpug.wordpress.com) meet the third Thursday of every month at Iovation. Our regular meetings tend to be pretty casual affairs; presentations often evolve into a conversation or problem-solving session. A list of past talks can be found on the Postgres wiki: <https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PDXPUG_Talks>."
summary = "The **PostgreSQL for Developers** talk begins with a simple use case for developers to solve entirely in SQL. Discover SQL window functions if you don't know them already, and then see about advanced PostgreSQL stuff such as ranges."
