conference = "[PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2013](https://2013.pgconf.eu) was held on October 29-November 1 in Dublin, Ireland, at the Conrad Dublin hotel. It delivered three days packed with presentations about PostgreSQL and related technologies, one day of extended trainings, and the usual hallway and social track!"
summary = """The first talk covers migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL in a single command line thanks to [pgloader](http://pgloader.io), your migration companion.

The second talk is a 3 hours-long tutorial about **Writing and Using PostgreSQL Extensions**, covering all the aspects from `create extension` to writing a PostgreSQL datatype in C, and implementing the indexing API. It's easier than you thought!"""
