The french PostgreSQL Conference, 
[pgday.fr](http://www.pgday.fr/programme), was yesterday in Lyon. We had a
very good time and a great schedule with a single track packed with 7 talks,
addressing a diverse set of PostgreSQL related topics, from GIS to fuzzy
logic, including replication.

You might have guessed it already, I did talk about replication. Here's the
slide deck I did use, it's in french, sorry if you don't grok that language.

The conference was very nice and did go smoothly, even if we were “only” 60
of us I had the pleasure to meet with different users with very different
set of needs. Very happy to have been there!
