Last week was 
[PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2012](http://2012.pgconf.eu/) in Prague, and it's been
awesome. Many thanks to the organisers who did manage to host a very smooth
conference with 
`290` attendees, including speakers. That means you kept
walking into interesting people to talk to, and in particular the 
*Hallway
Track* has been a giant success.

I did have the chance to speak several times at that event, and you can get
the slides at my 
[Conferences](../../../conferences.html) page that I try to keep up to date. I did one
talk about 
[Implementing High Availability](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/pgconfeu2012/session/318-implementing-high-availability/) that was about 2 hours long (a
double slot), 
[PGQ Cooperative Consumers](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/pgconfeu2012/session/373-lightning-talks/) that Marko Kreen copresented with me
and the 
[Large Scale MySQL Migration to PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/pgconfeu2012/session/317-large-scale-mysql-migration-to-postgresql/) that I already presented
before this year.

Next conference is in Lyon and will be in French, the talk is called
[Pr√©sentation de PostgreSQL](http://lyon.afup.org/2012/10/17/presentation-de-postgresql-31102012-a-19h30/). The audience is going to be composed of PHP
developers interested to know more about PostgreSQL, I'll tell you how it
goes!
