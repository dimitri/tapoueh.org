In case you're wondering, here are the slides from the 
[CHAR(11)](http://char11.org/) talk I gave,
about 
[Skytools](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SkyTools) 
`3.0`, 
*soon* to be released.  That means as soon as I have
enough time available to polish (or write) the documentation.

         

<div class="figure dim-margin">
  <a href="/images/confs/skytools3.pdf">

  </a>
</div>


The slides for all the talks should eventually make their way to a central
place, but expect some noticable delay here.  Sorry about that, and have a
good reading meanwhile!
