I stumbled upon the following 
*cheat sheet* for 
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) yesterday, and it's
worth sharing.  I already learnt or discovered again some nice default
chords, like for example 
`C-x C-o runs the command delete-blank-lines` and
`C-M-o runs the command split-line`.  I guess I will use the later one a lot.
