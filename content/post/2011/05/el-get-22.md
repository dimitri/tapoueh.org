We've spotted a little too late for our own taste a discrepancy in the
source tree: a work in progress patch landed in git just before to release
[el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) stable.  So we cleaned the tree (thanks again 
[Julien](http://julien.danjou.info/)), branched a
stable maintenance tree, and released 
`2.2` from there.

You're back to enjoying 
`el-get` :)
