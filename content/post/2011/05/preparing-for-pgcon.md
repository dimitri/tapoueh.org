It's this time of the year again, the main international
[PostgreSQL Conference](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/) is next week in Ottawa, Canada.  If previous years are
any indication, this will be great event where to meet with a lot of the
members of your community.  The core team will be there, developers will be
there, and we will meet with users and their challenging use cases.

This is a very good time to review both what you did in the project those
last 12 months, and what you plan to do next year.  To help with that,
several 
*meeting* events are organized.  They're like a whole-day round table
with a kind of an agenda, with a limited number of invited people in, and
very intense on-topic discussions about how to organize ourselves for
another great year of innovation in PostgreSQL.

Then we have two days full of talks where I usually learn some new aspect of
the project or of the product, and where ideas tend to just pop-up in a
continuous race.  Being away from home and with people you see only once a
year (some of them more than that of course, hi European fellows!) seems to
allow for some broader thinking.

The talks I want to go to include
[Database Scalability Patterns: Sharding for Unlimited Growth](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/361.en.html) by
[Robert Treat](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/20.en.html), 
[Maintaining Terabytes](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/366.en.html) by 
[Selena Deckelmann](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/112.en.html), 
[NTTâ€™s Case Report](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/307.en.html)
by 
[Tetsuo Sakata](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/192.en.html), 
[Hacking the Query Planner](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/350.en.html) by 
[Tom Lane](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/202.en.html).  That's for a first
day, right?

Then, on the second day, I notice 
[Range Types](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/311.en.html) by 
[Jeff Davis](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/83.en.html),
[SP-GiST - a new indexing infrastructure for PostgreSQL](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/309.en.html) by 
[Oleg](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/29.en.html) and 
[Teodor](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/33.en.html),
[The Write Stuff](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/337.en.html) by 
[Greg Smith](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/110.en.html) (a colleague at 
[2ndQuadrant](http://www.2ndquadrant.fr/)).

I will miss 
[Serializable Snapshot Isolation in Postgres](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/333.en.html) by 
[Kevin Grittner](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/113.en.html)
and 
[Dan Ports](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/speakers/197.en.html), unfortunately, because I'll be talking about
[Extensions Development](http://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/events/280.en.html) at the same time.

Well of course this list is just a first selection, hallway tracks are often
what guides me through talks or make me skip some.

See you there!
