This year again I'm going to 
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2013/), and to the extra special
[PostgreSQL FOSDEM day](http://fosdem2013.pgconf.eu/). It will be the first time that I'm going to be at the
event for the full week-end rather than just commuting in for the day.

*I'm Going to the FOSDEM, hope to see you there!*

And I'm presenting two talks over there that are both currently scheduled on
the Sunday in the 
[PostgreSQL devroom](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/postgresql/). We're talking about changing that
though, so that one of those will in fact happen 
***this Friday*** at the
[FOSDEM PGDay 2013](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/fosdem2013/), which has a different schedule, so consider watching for
that.

One of those two talks is about 
[Implementing High Availability](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/postgresql_implementing_high_availability/) (yes, with
PostgreSQL). It's been quite well received in the places I had to chance to
make it before (namely 
*PGDay France* and 
*PG Conf Europe*), and it's going to
be a stripped down version of it so that it fits well in the 45 mins slot we
have here.

The other talk is going to be about 
[Event Triggers](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/postgresql_event_triggers/), a feature new in
PostgreSQL 9.3 (due in september 2013, crossing fingers) and while the goal
of that talk is to introduce what the feature is all about and a bunch of
use cases that you can address by using it, it will certainly offer a peek
into the PostgreSQL development cycle and community processes.
