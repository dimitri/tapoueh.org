The 
[Emacs Conference](http://emacsconf.herokuapp.com/) is happening, it's real, and it will take place at the
end of this month in London. Check it out, and register at
[Emacs Conference Event Brite](http://emacsconf.eventbrite.co.uk/). It's free and there's still some availability.

<center>*It's all about Emacs, and it rocks!*</center>

We have a great line-up for this conference, which makes me proud to be able
to be there. If you've ever been paying attention when using 
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) then
you've already heard those names: 
[Sacha Chua](http://sachachua.com/blog/) is frequently blogging about
how she manages to improve her workflow thanks to 
[Emacs Lisp](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/), 
[John Wiegley](https://github.com/jwiegley)
is a proficient Emacs contributor maybe best known for his 
[ledger](https://github.com/ledger/ledger) 
*Emacs
Mode*, then we have 
[Luke Gorrie](http://www.lukego.com/) who hacked up 
[SLIME](http://wingolog.org/archives/2006/01/02/slime) among other things, we
also have 
[Nic Ferrier](http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/) who is starting a revolution in how to use 
*Emacs Lisp*
with 
[elnode](http://elnode.org/). And more! Including 
[Steve Yegge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge)!

<center>See you there in London.</center>
