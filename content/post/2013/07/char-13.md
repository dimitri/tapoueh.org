Last week was held the 
[CHAR(13)](http://char13.info/schedule) conference in a great venue in the UK
countryside. Not only did we discover UK under good weather conditions and
some local beers, we also did share a lot of good ideas!

The conference was run side to side with 
[PGDAY UK](http://postgresqlusergroup.org.uk/schedule), and those two days were
packed with great conferences!

I had the pleasure to present a talk about 
*Advanced Distributed
Architectures* where some examples of architectures using 
*Streaming
Replication*, 
*Skytools* and 
*PLproxy* are shown.

The main thing to remember might be that replication only is a tool!
