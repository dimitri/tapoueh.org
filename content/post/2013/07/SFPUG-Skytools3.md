Those days feel really lucky to me. I'm currently visiting friends and
customers in San Francisco, and really enjoying my trip here! Of course
[Josh Berkus](http://www.databasesoup.com/) took the opportunity to organise a 
**SFPUG** meeting and I had the
pleasure of being the speaker over there.

My talk was about the most recent version of 
[Skytools](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SkyTools) and the opportunity to
realise that we're still missing a lot on documentation. One of the attendee
did propose to help us on that front as he apparently really likes technical
writing. I hope that effort will happen and help solve the main issue here.

The talk then generated a lot of questions from the audience, ranging from
how to upgrade from previous version (I covered tha topic in
[Live Upgrading PGQ](/blog/2013/02/08-PGQ-Live-Upgrade) here) to lots of details about operating 
*londiste* and the
many options you have to control 
*batch size* and 
*lag*.

Mainly as the talk was oriented towards 
*how to use skytools* rather than 
*use
cases and architectures*, the questions were centered around how to solve
problems using the tools.

I think the best part of it for me was that our host 
[Bazaarvoice](http://www.bazaarvoice.com/) actually is
using 
*Skytools* and as a result were really interested into the talk and
asked very good questions too!
