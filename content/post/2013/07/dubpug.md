Tonight I had the pleasure to present a talk at the
[Dublin PostgreSQL User Group](http://www.meetup.com/PostgreSQL-user-group-Ireland-ie-pug/) using remote technologies. The talk is about
how to make the most ouf of PostgreSQL when using SQL as a developer, and
tries to convince you to dive into 
***mastering SQL*** by showing how to solve an
application example all in SQL, using 
*window functions* and 
*common table
expressions*.
