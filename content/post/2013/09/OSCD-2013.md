Have you heard about the 
[Open World Forum](http://openworldforum.org/en/) conference that takes place in
Paris, October 3-5, 2013? I'll be presenting a talk about 
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) in the
track 
***NewSQL: Managing large data sets with relational technologies***.

*Open World Forum used to be Open Source Developers Conference*

My talk is 
[PostgreSQL is web scale](http://openworldforum.org/en/tracks/24#talk_41) and here's the summary:

> We call it the world's most advanced open source database, and we are
> actually offering in the same package full ACID compliance per default and
> advanced trade-offs to reach any kind of flexibility needed, all with
> per-transaction controls. That's including your replication and High
> Availability setup. Given proper use of those controls and some schemaless
> extensions, PostgreSQL really is web scale!


I hope to meet you there, on Friday the 4th of October, 10am!
