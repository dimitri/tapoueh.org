Last Friday I had the chance to be speaking at the 
[Open World Forum](http://openworldforum.org/en/) in the
***NewSQL*** track, where we had lots of interest and excitement around the 
***NoSQL***
offerings. Of course, my talk was about explaining how
[PostgreSQL is Web Scale](http://openworldforum.org/en/tracks/24#talk_41) with some historical background and technical
examples about what this database engine is currently capable of.

<center>*PostgreSQL is Web Scale. PostgreSQL is YeSQL!*</center>

The conclusion of the talk is that indeed, 
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) is 
***YeSQL***!
