At the 
[Open World Forum](http://openworldforum.org/en/) two weeks ago I had the pleasure to meet with
[Colin Charles](http://www.bytebot.net/blog/). We had a nice talk about the current state of both 
[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
and 
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), and even were both interviewed by the Open World Forum Team.
The interview is now available online. Dear French readers, it's in English.


*Allo Mum? Yeah, I'm on TV. Well, Actually, Internet TV.*

Here's the video:

Executive Summary: MariaDB is a drop-in fully Open Source replacement for
MySQL and sees quite some progress and innovation being made, and 
***PostgreSQL
is YeSQL!***
