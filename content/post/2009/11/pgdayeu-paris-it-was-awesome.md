moment. Lots of 
[attendees](http://2009.pgday.eu/_media/group_2009_1.jpg?cache=), lots of quality talks (
[slides](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGDay.EU%2C_Paris_2009) are online), good
food, great party: all the ingredients were there!

It also was for me the occasion to first talk about this tool I've been
working on for months, called 
[pg_staging](pgstaging.html), which aims to empower those boring
production backups to help maintaining 
*staging* environments (for your
developers and testers).

All in all such events keep reminding me what it means exactly when we way
that one of the greatest things about 
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) is its community. If you
don't know what I'm talking about, consider 
[joining](http://www.postgresql.org/community/)!
