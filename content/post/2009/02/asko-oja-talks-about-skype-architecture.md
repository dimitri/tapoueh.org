In this 
[russian page](http://postgresqlrussia.org/articles/view/131) you'll see a nice presentation of Skype databases
architectures by Asko Oja himself. It's the talk at Russian PostgreSQL
Community meeting, October 2008, Moscow, and it's a good read.

The presentation page is in russian but the slides are in English, so have a
nice read!
