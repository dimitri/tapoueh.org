I was lucky to participate as a speaker to the 
[Nordic PostgreSQL Day 2015](http://2015.nordicpgday.org/)
and it's been another awesome edition of the conference. Really smooth,
everything has been running as it should, with about one hundred people at
the conference.

You can get the slides I've been using for my talk at the 
[Nordic pgDay 2015](http://tapoueh.org/confs/2015/03/11-Nordic-pgDay-2015)
page on the 
[Conferences](http://tapoueh.org/conferences) pages of this website.

The 
***Nordic pgDay*** is such a successful conference that I long wanted to have
just the same in my area, and so we made 
[pgDay Paris](http://pgday.paris/) and modeled it against
Nordic. It's planned to be all the same, just with a different audience
given the location.

The 
[pgDay Paris](http://pgday.paris/) welcomes English Speaking speakers and the Call for Papers
is now open, so please consider
[submitting your talk proposal for pgDay Paris](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/callforpapers/pgdayparis2015/) by cliking on the link and
filling in a form. Not too hard a requirement for being allowed to visit
such a nice city as Paris, really!
