Thanks to the 
[Postgres Weekly issue #89](http://postgresweekly.com/issues/89) and a post to 
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) front page
(see 
[Pgloader: A High-speed PostgreSQL Swiss Army Knife, Written in Lisp](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8924270) it
well seems that I just had my first 
[Slashdot effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect)...

<!--more-->

So please consider using the new mirror 
[http://dimitri.github.io/pgloader/](http://dimitri.github.io/pgloader/)
and maybe voting on 
*Hacker News* for either tooling around
[your favorite database system, PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) or
[your favorite programming language, Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/introduction-why-lisp.html)...

It all happens at

## Coming to FOSDEM?

If you want to know more about 
*pgloader* and are visiting 
[FOSDEM PGDAY](http://fosdem2015.pgconf.eu/) or
plain 
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/) I'll be there talking about
[Migrating to PostgreSQL, the new story](http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/fosdem2015/session/827-migrating-to-postgresql-the-new-story/) (that's 
*pgloader*) and about some more
reasons why 
[You'd better have tested backups...](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/youd_better_have_tested_backups/)

If you're not there on the Friday but still want to talk about 
*pgloader*,
join us at the PostgreSQL devroom and booth!
