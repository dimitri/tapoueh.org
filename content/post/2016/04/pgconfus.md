[PostgreSQL Conference US](https://www.pgconf.us/conferences/2016) took
place in New York City and I had the pleasure to be a speaker there. I
presented there a talk about why *Youâ€™d Better Have Tested Backups*. The
important bit is that backups are not interesting, recoveries are. Also the
only way to make sure a backup is successful is to be able to use it for
recovery.

Here are the slides for the talk:

Of course the conference hosted a *lightning talk* session and I took the
opportunity to talk about [pgloader](http://pgloader.io), and here are the
slides for this one:
