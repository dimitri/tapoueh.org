Now that my book [Mastering PostgreSQL in Application
Development](https://masteringpostgresql.com) is released (and selling well,
thanks guys!), I've had some questions about the title.

The idea is that to become good at anything, we need to practice. We
practice a lot, and it's even better when we are actively trying to learn,
following what's named [deliberate
practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice).

If you think about learning martial arts or maybe learning to play a musical
instrument, then it's easier to realize what lies behind the name
*Mastering*: daily deliberate practice will lead you to *master* your art.
Also, you don't get to skip a difficult movement or learn a piece of music
except for that part in the middle that is a little too complex. You make
progress by practicing until you *master* every aspect of what you are
learning.

The whole idea behind the concept of **Mastering** as a path to a better
learning process is nicely explained in the following Ted Talk by **Sal
Khan**:

> Would you choose to build a house on top of an unfinished foundation? Of
> course not. Why, then, do we rush students through education when they
> haven't always grasped the basics? Yes, it's complicated, but educator Sal
> Khan shares his plan to turn struggling students into scholars by helping
> them master concepts at their own pace.

So as the Ted Talk title puts it, _Let's teach for mastery — not tests
scores_:

Now, if you're interested in SQL and PostgreSQL, consider buying [Mastering
PostgreSQL in Application Development](https://masteringpostgresql.com). I'm
going to spoil the very last lines of it here… which are actually a quote:

> _Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice._

> — ***Anton Chekhov***

So once you've bought the book, and read through it, then remember what the
title actually means. You get to practice. Again and again. That's how the
book is going to be of value to you!
