[Mastering PostgreSQL in Application
Development](http://masteringpostgresql.com) is the full title of the book I
am currently writing. Running the [PostgreSQL is YeSQL](/categories/yesql/)
series of blog posts has shown me developers need a ***PostgreSQL book for
developers***. A book with the same properties as the *YeSQL* series
articles in this blog:

  - we use real world data sets to put every query and SQL technique we
    learn in the context of a *user story* or *business case*,
    
  - we include practical ideas about daily developer's concerns on how to
    actually integrate SQL in your application's code base, code review
    processes, versioning, testing and deployment,
    
  - we explain and teach basic and advanced SQL concepts, with a
    progression, and hints on use cases when you might need to use the same
    technics,
    
  - we provide best practices and alternative ideas for advanced topics
    where there's no *one size fits all* solution possible,
    
  - we include sample code in different programming languages, code that you
    can actually run, and which solves a simple but real use case.

In [Mastering PostgreSQL in Application
Development](http://masteringpostgresql.com) every query uses a real world
dataset that is available for download and easy to load into your local
PostgreSQL instance. Scripts to load the data are provided, including
clean-up and reformating scripts when necessary. It means that you can
actually run and edit every single query used in the book against the same
data set!
