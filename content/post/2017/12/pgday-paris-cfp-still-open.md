[pgDay Paris](https://2018.pgday.paris) 4th edition happens March 15, 2018!
And the [Call for Papers](https://2018.pgday.paris/callforpapers/) is still
open, as it closes with the year: _the submission deadline is December 31st,
2017_.

As I've been organizing the first edition of *pgDay Paris* back in 2015,
this very conference is special to me! It's been an amazing experience
launching a new [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) conference…

Hats off to [Magnus](https://www.hagander.net) without whom the first
edition would never have happened, and to
[Vik](https://twitter.com/pg_xocolatl) of course, who took over the
organisation of the conference!

# PostgreSQL Europe

The [pgDay Paris](https://2018.pgday.paris) conference is part of the
[PostgreSQL Europe](https://www.postgresql.eu/donate/) conferences, a list
including both [Nordic pgDay](https://2018.nordicpgday.org) and the great
[PostgreSQL Conference Europe](https://2018.pgconf.eu), and more regional
conferences too. If you've not attented to *PostgreSQL Europe* yet, add it
to your list, really. And first consider
[pgday.Paris](https://2018.pgday.paris) as both date and location are
already known…

In particular *Nordic pgDay* and *pgDay Paris* are sister conferences: they
happen in the same week — Nordic happens in Oslo on March 13, pgDay.Paris
happens on March 15 — and they share quite a lot in between them. It is
possible for speakers to participate in both conferences and fly over from
Oslo to Paris with the organisation crew, who sure are present to both!

# Would you speak about PostgreSQL in Paris?

Join the fun, submit your talk to pgday Paris today, we would be delighted
to have you as a speaker!
