I am writing a book to share my knowledge about how to best
use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as an application developer. If
you've evered ask yourself *how much should I have my database do for me?*
this book is for you. If you're thinking that using an ORM might not always
be the best option out there, if sometimes you wish SQL was easier to
maintain than those concatenated strings with conditionals, then this book
can't wait for you!

*Mastering PostgreSQL in Application Development* is answering practical
questions every developer is confronted to when using PostgreSQL. For
instance, should PostgreSQL be a convenient remote storage facility, or is
there something more to it that comes with those ACID properties?
