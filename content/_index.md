<h1><center>Welcome to Dimitri Fontaine's website!</center></h1>

<hr/>

In this place I share my [PostgreSQL](/tags/postgresql/) expertise. You will
find about my [projects](/projects/) of course, and the blog is full of
interesting articles: have a try
at
[Understanding Window Functions](/blog/2013/08/understanding-window-functions/) which
has been helpful to many readers! This article is even part of a data driven
series of post, the [YeSQL](/categories/yesql/) category, check it out!

Also, I'm writing a book
about
[Mastering PostgreSQL in Application Development](http://masteringpostgresql.com),
and you can subscribe to get sample content before anyone else and be the
first to get the book when it's available!
