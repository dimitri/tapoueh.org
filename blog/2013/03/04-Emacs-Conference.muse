how she manages to improve her workflow thanks to [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/][Emacs Lisp]], [[https://github.com/jwiegley][John Wiegley]]
is a proficient Emacs contributor maybe best known for his [[https://github.com/ledger/ledger][ledger]] *Emacs
Mode*, then we have [[http://www.lukego.com/][Luke Gorrie]] who hacked up [[http://wingolog.org/archives/2006/01/02/slime][SLIME]] among other things, we
also have [[http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/][Nic Ferrier]] who is starting a revolution in how to use *Emacs Lisp*
