* prefix 1.0~rc2 in debian testing

At long last, [[http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=prefix][here it is]]. With binary versions both for =postgresal-8.3= and
=postgresal-8.4=! Unfortunately my other packaging efforts are still waiting
on the =NEW= queue, but I hope to soon see =hstore-new= and =preprepare= enter
debian too.

Anyway, the plan for =prefix= is to now wait something like 2 weeks, then,
baring showstopper bugs, release the =1.0= final version. If you have a use
for it, now is the good time for testing it!

About upgrading a current =prefix= installation, the advice is to save data as
=text= instead of =prefix_range=, remove prefix support, install new version,
change again the columns data type:

<src lang="sql">
BEGIN;
  ALTER TABLE foo
     ALTER COLUMN prefix
             TYPE text USING text(prefix);

  DROP TYPE prefix_range CASCADE;
  \i prefix.sql

  ALTER TABLE foo
     ALTER COLUMN prefix
             TYPE prefix_range USING prefix_range(prefix);

  CREATE INDEX idx_foo_prefix ON foo
         USING gist(prefix gist_prefix_range_ops);
COMMIT;
</src>

Note: I just added the =gist_prefix_range_ops= as default for type
=prefix_range= so it'll be optional to specify this in final =1.0=. I got so
used to typing it I didn't realize we don't have to :)
