A very good remark from some users: installing and managing =el-get= should be
simpler. They wanted both an easy install of the thing, and a way to be able
to manage it afterwards (like, update the local copy against the
authoritative source). So I decided it was high time for getting the code
out of my =~/.emacs.d= git repository and up to a public place:
[[http://github.com/dimitri/el-get]].

Then, I added some documentation (a =README=), and then, a =*scratch*
installer=, following great ideas from =ELPA=. So have at it, it's a copy paste
away! 

Don't forget to setup your =el-get-sources= and include there the =el-get=
source for updates, there's nothing magic about it so it's up to you. You
may notice that it's not yet possible to init =el-get= from =el-get-sources=,
though, that's the drawback of the lack of magic. So you will have to still
add an explicit =(require 'el-get)= before to go and define you own
=el-get-sources= then finally =(el-get)=. I don't think that's a problem I need
to solve, though.
