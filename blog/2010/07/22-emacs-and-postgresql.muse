* Emacs and PostgreSQL

Those are my two all times favorite Open Source Software. Or [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][Free Software]]
in the [[http://www.gnu.org/][GNU]] sense of the world, as both the *BSD* and the *GPL* are labeled free
there. Even if I prefer the [[http://www.debian.org/social_contract][The Debian Free Software Guidelines]] as a global
definition and the [[http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/][WTFPL]] license. But that's a digression.

I think that [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[http://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]] do share a lot in common. I'd begin with
the documentation, which quality is amazing for both projects. Then of
course the extensibility with [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/html_node/Preface.html#Preface][Emacs Lisp]] on the one hand and
[[http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/extend.html][catalog-driven operations]] on the other hand. Whether you're extending Emacs
or PostgreSQL you'll find that it's pretty easy to tweak the system *while
it's running*. The other comparison points are less important, like the fact
the both the systems get about the same uptime on my laptop (currently *13
days, 23 hours, 57 minutes, 10 seconds*).

So of course I'm using *Emacs* to edit *PostgreSQL* =.sql= files, including stored
procedures. And it so happens that [[http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2010-07/msg01067.php][line numbering in plpgsql]] is not as
straightforward as one would naively think, to the point that we'd like to
have better tool support there. So I've extended Emacs [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minor-Modes.html][linum-mode minor mode]]
to also display the line numbers as computed per PostgreSQL, and here's what
it looks like:

Now, here's also the source code, [[https://github.com/dimitri/pgsql-linum-format][pgsql-linum-format]]. Hope you'll enjoy!
