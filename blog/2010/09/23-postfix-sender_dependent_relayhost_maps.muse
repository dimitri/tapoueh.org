* Postfix sender_dependent_relayhost_maps

The previous article about [[http://tapoueh.org/articles/news/_Scratch_that_itch:_M-x_mailq.html][M-x mailq]] has raised several mails asking me
details about the [[http://www.postfix.com/][Postfix]] setup I'm talking about. The problem we're trying
to solve is having a local =MTA= to send mails, so that any old-style Unix
tool just works, instead of only the =MUA= you've spent time setting up.

Postfix makes it possible to do that quite easily, but it gets a little more
involved if you have more than one *relayhost* that you want to use depending
on your current *From* address. Think personal email against work email, or
avoiding your =ISP= network when sending your private mails, *hoping* directly
on a server you own or trust.

So how do you do just that? Let's see the relevant parts of =main.cf=.

<src>
relayhost = your.default.relay.host.here
relay_domains = domain.org, work-domain.com, other-domain.info
smtp_sender_dependent_authentication = yes
sender_dependent_relayhost_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/relaymap
</src>

The =relaymap= looks like this:

<src lang="conf-unix">
# comments
user@domain.org         mail.domain.org
local@work-domain.com   smtp.work-domain.com
# that requires a local tunnel started with ssh, see ~/.ssh/config
me@other-domain.info    [127.0.0.1]:10025
</src>

You need to use [[http://www.postfix.org/postmap.1.html][postmap]] on this file before to reload or restart your local
instance of Postfix.

Also, you should want to crypt your communication to your preferred relay
host, using =TLS= goes like this:

<src>
smtp_sasl_auth_enable=yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/sasl-passwords
smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = digest-md5
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = login, plain
smtp_sasl_type = cyrus

smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${queue_directory}/smtp_scache
smtp_tls_loglevel = 2
smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_tls_security_level = may
</src>

The password file will need to get parsed by =postmap= too, and would better
be set with limited read access, and looks like this:

<src lang="conf-unix">
mail.domain.org        user@domain.org:password
smtp.work-domain.com   local@work-domain.com:h4ckm3
[127.0.0.1]:10025      me@other-domain.info:guess
</src>

Hope this help you get started, at least that's a document I would have
enjoyed reading when I first started to setup my local relaying =MTA=.

Oh, and now that you have this, I hope you will enjoy my =M-x mailq= tool for
occasions when you're wondering why you're not receiving an answer back yet,
then start the ssh tunnelâ€¦
