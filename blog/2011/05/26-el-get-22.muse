We've spotted a little too late for our own taste a discrepancy in the
source tree: a work in progress patch landed in git just before to release
[[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] stable.  So we cleaned the tree (thanks again [[http://julien.danjou.info/][Julien]]), branched a
stable maintenance tree, and released =2.2= from there.

You're back to enjoying =el-get= :)
