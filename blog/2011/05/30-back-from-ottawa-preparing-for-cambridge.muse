While [[http://blog.hagander.net/][Magnus]] is all about [[http://2011.pgconf.eu/][PG Conf EU]] already, you have to realize we're just
landed back from [[http://www.pgcon.org/2011/][PG Con]] in Ottawa.  My next stop in the annual conferences
is [[http://char11.org/][CHAR 11]], the *Clustering, High Availability and Replication* conference in
Cambridge, 11-12 July.  Yes, on the old continent this time.

This year's *pgcon* hot topics, for me, have been centered around a better
grasp at [[http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/transaction-iso.html#XACT-SERIALIZABLE][SSI]] and *DDL Triggers*.  Having those beasts in [[http://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]] would
allow for auditing, finer privileges management and some more automated
replication facilities.  Imagine that =ALTER TABLE= is able to fire a *trigger*,
provided by *Londiste* or *Slony*, that will do what's needed on the cluster by
itself.  That would be awesome, wouldn't it?

At *CHAR 11* I'll be talking about [[http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/SkyTools][Skytools 3]].  You know I've been working on
its *debian* packaging, now is the time to review the documentation and make
there something as good looking as the monitoring system are...

Well, expect some news and a nice big picture diagram overview soon, if work
schedule leaves me anytime that's what I want to be working on now.
