[[http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/][Tsung]] is an open-source multi-protocol distributed load testing tool and a
mature project.  It's been available for about 10 years and is built with
the [[http://www.erlang.org/][Erlang]] system.  It supports several protocols, including the [[http://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]]
one.

When you want to benchmark your own application, to know how many more
clients it can handle or how much gain you will see with some new shiny
hardware, [[http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/][Tsung]] is the tool to use.  It will allow you to *record* a number of
sessions then replay them at high scale.  [[http://pgfouine.projects.postgresql.org/tsung.html][pgfouine]] supports Tsung and is
able to turn your PostgreSQL logs into Tsung sessions, too.

Tsung did get used in the video game world, their version of it is called
[[http://www.developer.unitypark3d.com/tools/utsung/][uTsung]], apparently using the [[http://www.developer.unitypark3d.com/index.html][uLink]] game development facilities.  They even
made a video demo of uTsung, that you might find interresting:
