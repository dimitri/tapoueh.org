Last week was [[http://2012.pgconf.eu/][PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2012]] in Prague, and it's been
awesome. Many thanks to the organisers who did manage to host a very smooth
conference with =290= attendees, including speakers. That means you kept
walking into interesting people to talk to, and in particular the *Hallway
Track* has been a giant success.

I did have the chance to speak several times at that event, and you can get
the slides at my [[../../../conferences.html][Conferences]] page that I try to keep up to date. I did one
talk about [[http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/pgconfeu2012/session/318-implementing-high-availability/][Implementing High Availability]] that was about 2 hours long (a
double slot), [[http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/pgconfeu2012/session/373-lightning-talks/][PGQ Cooperative Consumers]] that Marko Kreen copresented with me
and the [[http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/pgconfeu2012/session/317-large-scale-mysql-migration-to-postgresql/][Large Scale MySQL Migration to PostgreSQL]] that I already presented
before this year.

Next conference is in Lyon and will be in French, the talk is called
[[http://lyon.afup.org/2012/10/17/presentation-de-postgresql-31102012-a-19h30/][Pr√©sentation de PostgreSQL]]. The audience is going to be composed of PHP
developers interested to know more about PostgreSQL, I'll tell you how it
goes!
