Thanks to the [[http://postgresweekly.com/issues/89][Postgres Weekly issue #89]] and a post to [[https://news.ycombinator.com/news][Hacker News]] front page
(see [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8924270][Pgloader: A High-speed PostgreSQL Swiss Army Knife, Written in Lisp]] it
well seems that I just had my first [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect][Slashdot effect]]...

	*Well actually you know what? I don't...*

So please consider using the new mirror [[http://dimitri.github.io/pgloader/]]
and maybe voting on *Hacker News* for either tooling around
[[http://postgresql.org][your favorite database system, PostgreSQL]] or
[[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/introduction-why-lisp.html][your favorite programming language, Common Lisp]]...

It all happens at [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8924270]].

** Coming to FOSDEM?

If you want to know more about *pgloader* and are visiting [[http://fosdem2015.pgconf.eu/][FOSDEM PGDAY]] or
plain [[https://fosdem.org/2015/][FOSDEM]] I'll be there talking about
[[http://www.postgresql.eu/events/schedule/fosdem2015/session/827-migrating-to-postgresql-the-new-story/][Migrating to PostgreSQL, the new story]] (that's *pgloader*) and about some more
reasons why [[https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/youd_better_have_tested_backups/][You'd better have tested backups...]]

If you're not there on the Friday but still want to talk about *pgloader*,
join us at the PostgreSQL devroom and booth!
