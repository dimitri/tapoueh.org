Thanks to the [[http://postgresweekly.com/issues/89][Postgres Weekly issue #89]] and a post to [[https://news.ycombinator.com/news][Hacker News]] front page
(see [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8924270][Pgloader: A High-speed PostgreSQL Swiss Army Knife, Written in Lisp]] it

	*Well actually you know what? I don't...*

So please consider using the new mirror [[http://dimitri.github.io/pgloader/]]
and maybe voting on *Hacker News* for either tooling around
[[http://postgresql.org][your favorite database system, PostgreSQL]] or
[[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/introduction-why-lisp.html][your favorite programming language, Common Lisp]]...

It all happens at [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8924270]].
