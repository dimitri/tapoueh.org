The PostgreSQL parallel ETL, writen in python. This little piece of software
is a layer atop the [[http://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]] =COPY= command. The difference between [[pgloader.html][pgloader]]
and plain =COPY= is the behavior in case of errors in the source data files
and the range of input formats supported.

And this little fact that pgloader is able to parallelize its tasks, loading
several file at once or even using more than one =CPU= to load a single source
file.
