[[http://images.google.com/images?q=clusterssh][ClusterSSH]] is about opening any number of =xterm=, =ssh= to a different remote
machine in each one of them, and providing user a unique input line to rule
them all.

[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ClusterSSH][ClusterSSH.el]] is about doing the same without quitting emacs, using =term.el=
as the terminal emulator and the =ClusterSSH= major mode for ruling them
all. It's available in [[http://tromey.com/elpa/index.html][ELPA]] and developed at the [[http://github.com/dimitri/cssh][github cssh]] repository.
