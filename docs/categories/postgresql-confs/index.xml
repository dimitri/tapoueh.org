      <title>Submit a Talk to pgDay Paris Today!</title>
      <link>https://tapoueh.org/blog/2017/12/submit-a-talk-to-pgday-paris-today/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2018.pgday.paris&#34;&gt;pgDay Paris&lt;/a&gt; 4th edition happens March 15, 2018!
And the &lt;a href=&#34;https://2018.pgday.paris/callforpapers/&#34;&gt;Call for Papers&lt;/a&gt; is still
open, as it closes with the year: &lt;em&gt;the submission deadline is December 31st,
2017&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve been organizing the first edition of &lt;em&gt;pgDay Paris&lt;/em&gt; back in 2015,
this very conference is special to me! It&amp;rsquo;s been an amazing experience
launching a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.postgresql.org&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; conference…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hats off to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hagander.net&#34;&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; without whom the first
edition would never have happened, and to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pg_xocolatl&#34;&gt;Vik&lt;/a&gt; of course, who took over the
organisation of the conference!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pgconf.us/conferences/2016&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL Conference US&lt;/a&gt; took
place in New York City and I had the pleasure to be a speaker there. I
presented there a talk about why &lt;em&gt;You’d Better Have Tested Backups&lt;/em&gt;. The
important bit is that backups are not interesting, recoveries are. Also the
only way to make sure a backup is successful is to be able to use it for
recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;http://allyourbaseconf.com/2015/speakers#dimitri-fontaine&#34;&gt;All Your Base Conference 2015&lt;/a&gt;
about
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postgresql.org&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; (of course). The conference gathers together lots of user
experience around data management and database products, either in the now
classic meaning of the word (I mean
&lt;em&gt;relational database management systems
here&lt;/em&gt;) or the newer set of trade-offs represented by the NoSQL set of tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Next month, Postgres Open 2014 is happening in Chicago, and I&amp;rsquo;ll have the pleasure to host a tutorial about PostgreSQL Extensions Writing &amp;amp; Using Postgres Extensions, and a talk aimed at developers wanting to make the best out of PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL for developers:
   
The tutorial is based on first hand experience on the PostgreSQL Extension Packaging System both as a user and a developer. It&amp;rsquo;s a series of practical use cases where using extensions will simplify your life a lot, and each of those practical use case is using real world data (thanks to pgloader).</description>

      <description>A couple of week ago I had the chance to participate into the PGConf NYC 2014 Conference, one of the biggest conferences about PostgreSQL worldwide.
I presented one of my favourite talks over there, where the whole goal is to blow the mind of innocent developers and show them how much they can do in just SQL.
   
PostgreSQL for developers, window functions galore!
The basis for the talk is this detailed blog entry about the Reset Counter application and how to leverage SQL to write the code for it.</description>

      <description>Last week I had the pleasure to present two talks at the awesome PostgreSQL Conference Europe. The first one was actually a tutorial about Writing &amp;amp; using Postgres Extensions where we spent 3 hours on what are PostgreSQL Extensions, what you can expect from them, and how to develop a new one. Then I also had the opportunity to present the new version of pgloader in a talk about Migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL.</description>

      <description>Last Friday I had the chance to be speaking at the Open World Forum in the NewSQL track, where we had lots of interest and excitement around the NoSQL offerings. Of course, my talk was about explaining how PostgreSQL is Web Scale with some historical background and technical examples about what this database engine is currently capable of.
   
PostgreSQL is Web Scale. PostgreSQL is YeSQL!
The conclusion of the talk is that indeed, PostgreSQL is YeSQL!</description>

      <description>Have you heard about the Open World Forum conference that takes place in Paris, October 3-5, 2013? I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting a talk about PostgreSQL in the track NewSQL: Managing large data sets with relational technologies.
   
Open World Forum used to be Open Source Developers Conference
My talk is PostgreSQL is web scale and here&amp;rsquo;s the summary:
 We call it the world&amp;rsquo;s most advanced open source database, and we are actually offering in the same package full ACID compliance per default and advanced trade-offs to reach any kind of flexibility needed, all with per-transaction controls.</description>

      <description>After spending an awesome week in San Francisco, CA I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to be spending another week in the USA, in Portand, OR. The main excuse for showing up here has been OSCON where I presented a talk about the fotolog migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL.
Mark Wong is doing some serious database crochet work!
Fotolog is a photo sharing website having more than 32 millions of users sharing more than a billion of photos, which made for a very interesting migration use case.</description>

      <description>Those days feel really lucky to me. I&amp;rsquo;m currently visiting friends and customers in San Francisco, and really enjoying my trip here! Of course Josh Berkus took the opportunity to organise a SFPUG meeting and I had the pleasure of being the speaker over there.
My talk was about the most recent version of Skytools and the opportunity to realise that we&amp;rsquo;re still missing a lot on documentation. One of the attendee did propose to help us on that front as he apparently really likes technical writing.</description>

      <description>Last week was held the CHAR(13) conference in a great venue in the UK countryside. Not only did we discover UK under good weather conditions and some local beers, we also did share a lot of good ideas!
The Hordwood House is quite of a maze really!
The conference was run side to side with PGDAY UK, and those two days were packed with great conferences!
I had the pleasure to present a talk about Advanced Distributed Architectures where some examples of architectures using Streaming Replication, Skytools and PLproxy are shown.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been to some more conferences and didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to blog about them, even though I really did have great fun over there. So I felt I should take some time and report about my experience at those conferences. And of course, some more is on the way, as the PostgreSQL Conference Tour gets busier each year it seems.
And PostgreSQL Conferences get more attendees each year!</description>

      <description>Tonight I had the pleasure to present a talk at the Dublin PostgreSQL User Group using remote technologies. The talk is about how to make the most ouf of PostgreSQL when using SQL as a developer, and tries to convince you to dive into mastering SQL by showing how to solve an application example all in SQL, using window functions and common table expressions.

      <description>The Emacs Conference is happening, it&amp;rsquo;s real, and it will take place at the end of this month in London. Check it out, and register at Emacs Conference Event Brite. It&amp;rsquo;s free and there&amp;rsquo;s still some availability.
It&amp;rsquo;s all about Emacs, and it rocks!
We have a great line-up for this conference, which makes me proud to be able to be there. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been paying attention when using Emacs then you&amp;rsquo;ve already heard those names: Sacha Chua is frequently blogging about how she manages to improve her workflow thanks to Emacs Lisp, John Wiegley is a proficient Emacs contributor maybe best known for his ledger Emacs Mode, then we have Luke Gorrie who hacked up SLIME among other things, we also have Nic Ferrier who is starting a revolution in how to use Emacs Lisp with elnode.</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s FOSDEM has been a great edition, in particular the FOSDEM PGDAY 2013 was a great way to begin a 3 days marathon of talking about PostgreSQL with people not only from our community but also from plenty other Open Source communities too: users!
  
  
PostgreSQL at FOSDEM made for a great event
Having had the opportunity to meet more people from those other development communities, I really think we should go and reach for them in their own conferences.</description>

      <description>The previous article FOSDEM 2013 said to be careful with the PostgreSQL devroom schedule because one of my talks there might get swapped with a slot on the FOSDEM PGDay 2013 which happens this Friday and has been sold out anyway.
Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not true, because we still depend on past century technologies somehow. Not everybody will be looking at the schedule on the web using a connected mobile device (you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of them, those tracking and surveillance devices, if you want to believe Stallman), and as the schedule gets printed on little paper sheets, it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunately too late to change it now.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m Going to the FOSDEM, hope to see you there!
And I&amp;rsquo;m presenting two talks over there that are both currently scheduled on the Sunday in the PostgreSQL devroom.</description>

      <description>As Guillaume says, we&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying a great evening conference in Lyon 2 days ago, presenting PostgreSQL to developers. He did the first hour presenting the project and the main things you want to know to start using PostgreSQL in production, then I took the opportunity to be talking to developers to show off some SQL.
   
That slide deck contains mainly SQL language, but some french too, rather than english.</description>

      <description>Last week was PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2012 in Prague, and it&amp;rsquo;s been awesome. Many thanks to the organisers who did manage to host a very smooth conference with 290 attendees, including speakers. That means you kept walking into interesting people to talk to, and in particular the Hallway Track has been a giant success.

I did have the chance to speak several times at that event, and you can get the slides at my Conferences page that I try to keep up to date.</description>

      <description>The PostgreSQL community host a number of conferences all over the year, and the next ones I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to get to are approaching fast now. First, next month in September, we have Postgres Open in Chicago, where my talk about Large Scale Migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL has been selected!
This talk shares hindsights about the why and the how of that migration, what problems couldn&amp;rsquo;t be solved without moving away and how the solution now looks.</description>

      <description>The french PostgreSQL Conference, pgday.fr, was yesterday in Lyon. We had a very good time and a great schedule with a single track packed with 7 talks, addressing a diverse set of PostgreSQL related topics, from GIS to fuzzy logic, including replication.
You might have guessed it already, I did talk about replication. Here&amp;rsquo;s the slide deck I did use, it&amp;rsquo;s in french, sorry if you don&amp;rsquo;t grok that language.</description>

This year&amp;rsquo;s issue has been packed with good things, beginning with the Cluster Summit then followed the next day by the Developer Meeting just followed (yes, in the same day) with the In Core Replication Meeting. That was a packed shedule!
The in core replication project has been presented with slides titled Future In-Core Replication for PostgreSQL and got a very good reception.</description>

      <description>Another great conference took place last week, PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2011 was in Amsterdam and plenty of us PostgreSQL geeks were too. I attended to lot of talks and did learn some more about our project, its community and its features, but more than that it was a perfect occasion to meet with the community.
Dave Page talked about SQL/MED under the title PostgreSQL at the center of your dataverse and detailed what to expert from a Foreign Data Wrapper in PostgreSQL 9.</description>

      <description>The next PostgreSQL conference is approaching very fast now, I hope you have your ticket already: it&amp;rsquo;s a very promissing event! If you want some help in deciding whether to register or not, just have another look at the schedule. Pick the talks you want to see. It&amp;rsquo;s hard, given how packed with good ones the schedule is. When you&amp;rsquo;re mind is all set, review the list. Registered?
I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting another talk about extensions, but this time I&amp;rsquo;ve geared up to use cases, with Extensions are good for business logic.</description>

  The slides for all the talks should eventually make their way to a central place, but expect some noticable delay here. Sorry about that, and have a good reading meanwhile!</description>

      <description>CHAR(11) finished somewhen in the night leading to today, if you consider the social events to be part of it, which I definitely do. This conference has been a very good one, both on the organisation side of things and of course for its content.
It began with a perspective about the evolution of replication solutions, by Jan Wieck himself. In some way Skytools is an evolution of Slony, in the sense that it reuses the same concepts, a part of the design, and even share bits of the implementation (like the txid_snapshot datatype that were added in PostgreSQL 8.</description>

      <description>While Magnus is all about PG Conf EU already, you have to realize we&amp;rsquo;re just landed back from PG Con in Ottawa. My next stop in the annual conferences is CHAR 11, the Clustering, High Availability and Replication conference in Cambridge, 11-12 July. Yes, on the old continent this time.
This year&amp;rsquo;s pgcon hot topics, for me, have been centered around a better grasp at SSI and DDL Triggers. Having those beasts in PostgreSQL would allow for auditing, finer privileges management and some more automated replication facilities.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve not been following closely you might have missed out on extensions integration. Well, Tom spent some time on the patches I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for the last 4 months. And not only did he commit most of the work but he also enhanced some parts of the code (better factoring) and basically finished it.
At the previous developer meeting his advice was to avoid putting too much into the very first version of the patch for it to stand its chances of being integrated, and while in the review process more than one major PostgreSQL contributor expressed worries about the size of the patch and the number of features proposed.</description>

In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering, my extension&amp;rsquo;s talk went quite well, and several people were kind enough to tell me they appreciated it!</description>

      <description>A quick blog entry to say that yes:
And I will even do my Extension&amp;rsquo;s talk which had a success at pgday.eu. The talk will be updated to include the last developments of the extension&amp;rsquo;s feature, as some of it changed already in between, and to detail the plan for the ALTER EXTENSION ... UPGRADE feature that I&amp;rsquo;d like to see included as soon as 9.1, but time is running so fast.</description>

      <description>At CHAR(10) Markus had a talk about Using MVCC for Clustered Database Systems and explained how Postgres-R does it. The scope of his project is to maintain a set of database servers in the same state, eventually.
Now, what does it mean to get &amp;ldquo;In the Cloud&amp;rdquo;? Well there are more than one answer I&amp;rsquo;m sure, mine would insist on including this &amp;ldquo;Elasticity&amp;rdquo; bit. What I mean here is that it&amp;rsquo;d be great to be able to add or lose nodes and stay online.</description>

      <description>It surely does not feel like a full month and some more went by since we were enjoying PGCon 2010, but in fact it was already the time for CHAR(10). The venue was most excellent, as Oxford is a very beautiful city. Also, the college was like a city in the city, and having the accomodation all in there really smoothed it all.
On a more technical viewpoint, the range of topics we talked about and the even broader one in the &amp;ldquo;Hall Track&amp;rdquo; make my mind full of ideas, again.</description>

      <description>moment. Lots of attendees, lots of quality talks ( slides are online), good food, great party: all the ingredients were there!
It also was for me the occasion to first talk about this tool I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for months, called pg_staging, which aims to empower those boring production backups to help maintaining staging environments (for your developers and testers).
All in all such events keep reminding me what it means exactly when we way that one of the greatest things about PostgreSQL is its community.</description>

      <description>In this russian page you&amp;rsquo;ll see a nice presentation of Skype databases architectures by Asko Oja himself. It&amp;rsquo;s the talk at Russian PostgreSQL Community meeting, October 2008, Moscow, and it&amp;rsquo;s a good read.
   
The presentation page is in russian but the slides are in English, so have a nice read!</description>
