      <description>Last week was the annual PostgreSQL Hackers gathering in Canada, thanks to the awesome pgcon conference. This year&amp;rsquo;s issue has been packed with good things, beginning with the Cluster Summit then followed the next day by the Developer Meeting just followed (yes, in the same day) with the In Core Replication Meeting. That was a packed shedule!
The in core replication project has been presented with slides titled Future In-Core Replication for PostgreSQL and got a very good reception.</description>
