      <description>While making progress with both Event Triggers and Extension Templates, I needed to make a little break. My current keeping sane mental exercise seems to mainly involve using Common Lisp, a programming language that ships with about all the building blocks you need.
Yes, that old language brings so much on the table
When using Common Lisp, you have an awesome interactive development environment where you can redefine function and objects while testing them.</description>

      <description>pgloader is a tool to help loading data into PostgreSQL, adding some error management to the COPY command. COPY is the fast way of loading data into PostgreSQL and is transaction safe. That means that if a single error appears within your bulk of data, you will have loaded none of it. pgloader will submit the data again in smaller chunks until it&amp;rsquo;s able to isolate the bad from the good, and then the good is loaded in.</description>
