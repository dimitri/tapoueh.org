      <title>PostgreSQL 9.1</title>

      <description>PostgreSQL 9.1 est dans les bacs ! Vous n&amp;rsquo;avez pas encore cette nouvelle version en production ? Pas encore évalué pourquoi vous devriez envisager de migrer à cette version ? Il existe beaucoup de bonnes raisons de passer à cette version, et peu de pièges.
Nous commençons à lire des articles qui reprennent la nouvelle dans la presse française, et j&amp;rsquo;ai le plaisir de mentionner celui de programmez.com qui annonce « un système d&amp;rsquo;extensions inégalé ».</description>

      <title>Multi-Version support for Extensions</title>

      <description>We still have this problem to solve with extensions and their packaging. How to best organize things so that your extension is compatible with before 9.1 and 9.1 and following releases of PostgreSQL?
Well, I had to do it for the ip4r contribution, and I wanted the following to happen:
dpkg-deb: building package `postgresql-8.3-ip4r&#39; ... dpkg-deb: building package `postgresql-8.4-ip4r&#39; ... dpkg-deb: building package `postgresql-9.0-ip4r&#39; ... dpkg-deb: building package `postgresql-9.1-ip4r&#39; ...  And here&amp;rsquo;s a simple enough way to achieve that.</description>

      <title>Back from Ottawa, preparing for Cambridge</title>

      <description>While Magnus is all about PG Conf EU already, you have to realize we&amp;rsquo;re just landed back from PG Con in Ottawa. My next stop in the annual conferences is CHAR 11, the Clustering, High Availability and Replication conference in Cambridge, 11-12 July. Yes, on the old continent this time.
This year&amp;rsquo;s pgcon hot topics, for me, have been centered around a better grasp at SSI and DDL Triggers. Having those beasts in PostgreSQL would allow for auditing, finer privileges management and some more automated replication facilities.</description>

      <description>While currently too busy at work to deliver much Open Source contributions, let&amp;rsquo;s debunk an old habit of PostgreSQL extension authors. It&amp;rsquo;s all down to copy pasting from contrib, and there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to continue doing $libdir this way ever since 7.4 days.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example here, with the prefix extension. This one too will need some love, but is still behind on my spare time todo list, sorry about that.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve not been following closely you might have missed out on extensions integration. Well, Tom spent some time on the patches I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for the last 4 months. And not only did he commit most of the work but he also enhanced some parts of the code (better factoring) and basically finished it.
At the previous developer meeting his advice was to avoid putting too much into the very first version of the patch for it to stand its chances of being integrated, and while in the review process more than one major PostgreSQL contributor expressed worries about the size of the patch and the number of features proposed.</description>

      <title>Back from FOSDEM</title>

      <description>This year we were in the main building of the conference, and apparently the booth went very well, solding lots of PostgreSQL merchandise etc. I had the pleasure to once again meet with the community, but being there only 1 day I didn&amp;rsquo;t spend as much time as I would have liked with some of the people there.
In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering, my extension&amp;rsquo;s talk went quite well, and several people were kind enough to tell me they appreciated it!</description>

      <description>A quick blog entry to say that yes:
And I will even do my Extension&amp;rsquo;s talk which had a success at pgday.eu. The talk will be updated to include the last developments of the extension&amp;rsquo;s feature, as some of it changed already in between, and to detail the plan for the ALTER EXTENSION ... UPGRADE feature that I&amp;rsquo;d like to see included as soon as 9.1, but time is running so fast.</description>

      <title>Introducing Extensions</title>

      <description>After reading Simon&amp;rsquo;s blog post, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but try to give some details about what it is exactly that I&amp;rsquo;m working on. As he said, there are several aspects to extensions in PostgreSQL, it all begins here: Chapter 35. Extending SQL.
It&amp;rsquo;s possible, and mostly simple enough, to add your own code or behavior to PostgreSQL, so that it will use your code and your semantics while solving user queries.</description>

      <title>Date puzzle for starters</title>

      <description>The PostgreSQL IRC channel is a good place to be, for all the very good help you can get there, because people are always wanting to remain helpful, because of the off-topics discussions sometime, or to get to talk with community core members. And to start up your day too.
This morning&amp;rsquo;s question started simple : “how can I check if today is the &amp;ldquo;first sunday fo the month&amp;rdquo;. or &amp;ldquo;the second tuesday of the month&amp;rdquo; etc?</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s edition has been the best pgcon ever for me. Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s only my third time, but still :) As Josh said the &amp;ldquo;Hall Track&amp;rdquo; in particular was very good, and the Dev Meeting has been very effective!
Extensions This time I prepared some slides to present the extension design and I tried hard to make it so that we get to agree on a plan, even recognizing it&amp;rsquo;s not solving all of our problems from the get go.</description>

      <title>Import fixed width data with pgloader</title>
      <link>http://tapoueh.org/blog/2010/04/import-fixed-width-data-with-pgloader/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2010 12:01:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://tapoueh.org/blog/2010/04/import-fixed-width-data-with-pgloader/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, following previous blog entries about importing
&lt;em&gt;fixed width&lt;/em&gt; data, from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/index.php?/archives/157-Import-fixed-width-data-into-PostgreSQL-with-just-PSQL.html&#34;&gt;Postgres Online Journal&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://people.planetpostgresql.org/dfetter/index.php?/archives/58-psql,-Paste,-Perl-Pefficiency!.html&#34;&gt;David (perl) Fetter&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist following
the meme and showing how to achieve the same thing with
&lt;a href=&#34;http://pgloader.projects.postgresql.org/#toc9&#34;&gt;pgloader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>prefix 1.1.0</title>
      <link>http://tapoueh.org/blog/2009/11/prefix-1.1.0/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2009 12:10:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://tapoueh.org/blog/2009/11/prefix-1.1.0/</guid>
      <description>So I had two bug reports about prefix in less than a week. It means several things, one of them is that my code is getting used in the wild, which is nice. The other side of the coin is that people do find bugs in there. This one is about the behavior of the btree opclass of the type prefix range. We cheat a lot there by simply having written one, because a range does not have a strict ordering: is [1-3] before of after [2-4]?</description>

      <title>Yet Another PostgreSQL tool hits debian</title>
      <link>http://tapoueh.org/blog/2009/11/yet-another-postgresql-tool-hits-debian/</link>

      <guid>http://tapoueh.org/blog/2009/11/yet-another-postgresql-tool-hits-debian/</guid>
      <description>So there it is, this newer contribution of mine that I presented at PGDay is now in debian NEW queue. pg_staging will empower you with respect to what you do about those nightly backups ( pg_dump -Fc or something).
The tool provides a lot of commands to either dump or restore a database. It comes with documentation covering about it all, except for the londiste support part, which will be there in time for 1.</description>
