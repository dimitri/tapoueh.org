      <description>Today is the day my book Mastering PostgreSQL in Application Development launches! I&amp;rsquo;m all excited that everybody interested is now able to actually read my book!
Mastering PostgreSQL in Application Development targets application developers who want to learn SQL properly, and actually master this programming language. Most developers don&amp;rsquo;t think of SQL as a programming language, mainly because they don&amp;rsquo;t have full control of the execution plan of their queries.</description>

      <description>I am writing a book to share my knowledge about how to best use PostgreSQL as an application developer. If you&amp;rsquo;ve evered ask yourself how much should I have my database do for me? this book is for you. If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking that using an ORM might not always be the best option out there, if sometimes you wish SQL was easier to maintain than those concatenated strings with conditionals, then this book can&amp;rsquo;t wait for you!</description>
