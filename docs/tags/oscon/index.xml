      <description>After spending an awesome week in San Francisco, CA I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to be spending another week in the USA, in Portand, OR. The main excuse for showing up here has been OSCON where I presented a talk about the fotolog migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL.
Mark Wong is doing some serious database crochet work!
Fotolog is a photo sharing website having more than 32 millions of users sharing more than a billion of photos, which made for a very interesting migration use case.</description>
