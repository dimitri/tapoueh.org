      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s FOSDEM has been a great edition, in particular the FOSDEM PGDAY 2013 was a great way to begin a 3 days marathon of talking about PostgreSQL with people not only from our community but also from plenty other Open Source communities too: users!
*PostgreSQL at FOSDEM made for a great event* Having had the opportunity to meet more people from those other development communities, I really think we should go and reach for them in their own conferences.</description>
