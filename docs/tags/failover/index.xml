      <description>&lt;p&gt;We just released &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/citusdata/pg_auto_failover/releases/tag/v1.6.3&#34;&gt;pg_auto_failover version
1.6.3&lt;/a&gt; on
GitHub, and the binary packages should be already available at the usual
PGDG and CitusData places, both for debian based distributions and RPM based
distributions too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is an introduction to the pg_auto_failover project: we answer
the &lt;em&gt;Five W&lt;/em&gt; questions, starting with why does the project exist in the
first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; pg_auto_failover is an awesome project. It fills the gap between
&lt;em&gt;“Postgres is awesome, makes developping my application so much easier, it
solves so many problems for me!”&lt;/em&gt; and the next step &lt;em&gt;“so, how do I run
Postgres in Production?”&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure how to bridge that gap
yourself, how to deploy your first production system with automated
failover, then pg_auto_failover is for you. It is simple to use, user
friendly, and well documented. &lt;strong&gt;Star it&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/citusdata/pg_auto_failover&#34;&gt;pg_auto_failover GitHub
repository&lt;/a&gt; and get started
today. Consider contributing to the project, it is fully Open Source, and
you are welcome to join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckle up, our guide tour is starting now!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Among a lot of other changes, the year 2020 brings Online Conferences to us. In the Postgres community too we now record our talks at home and send a video file to be playedto a virtual audience, and sometimes shared later in a platform online.
So this year I did participate in Postgres Vision 2020 where I did deliver a talk about The Art of PostgreSQL. This a talk all about the book that I have written and self-publish at The Art of PostgreSQL: learn how to turn thousands of lines of code into simple SQL queries.</description>
