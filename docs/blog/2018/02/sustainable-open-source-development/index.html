  <p>If you&rsquo;re reading this article as a Software Hacker, typically as an
Individual Contributor in your enterprise, that&rsquo;s good, I think you&rsquo;ll be
interested by the contents. That said, make sure to send it over to those
people who buy your software licenses and other stuff that you need to be
able to work, because I want <strong>them</strong> to read this piece. Them who may spend
company money can help making Open Source development sustainable…</p>

  <p>If you&rsquo;re reading this article as someone who is used to buy software
licenses for your developers to be able to work, either for interactive
editors or project management and online code repositories, please read this
article. <strong>TL;DR</strong>: if you&rsquo;re using <a href="https://pgloader.io">pgloader</a>,
contribute either time, money, or both to the project. Scroll to <a href="#the-pgloader-moral-license">The

<p>There&rsquo;s something common in the technologies listed above, and many more
you&rsquo;re most certainly relying on: all of them are Open Source Software. It

<h2 id="why-is-everybody-using-open-source">Why is Everybody Using Open Source?</h2>

<p>Open Source Software has not always been the first choice of enterprise as
pillars of their production infrastructure. It used to be that company
decisions would favor using proprietary software, closed source, with
expensive maintenance contracts. What it meant is that every single customer
of a given vendor would separately pay for the same bug fixes, unknowingly.</p>

<p>There was such a time when Open Source Software quality was not there yet,
so that you could not rely on them for running your production. And before
that, maybe the software wasn&rsquo;t available at all, or for your particular
hardware choice… yeah it used to be that people had a choice to make amongst
more than just 3 hardware architecture…</p>

<p>So how did we arrive at the current situation, where it doesn&rsquo;t make sense
anymore to use proprietary and closed source software for most of the
things? Investment is the answer. Individual hackers and contributors have
investing humongous amounts of time into their little Open Source Software
alternatives, up to a point where our Free Software catalog is running the
world.</p>

<p>Who paid for this initial investment? Public research labs and facilities
such as those running with universities, individuals on their <em>free time</em>,
and then slowly some private companies who allowed some of their staff to
use their paid time to contribute, up until when it has become obvious that
the best solution both in terms of economics and in terms of quality would
be to contribute to the common goods, our beloved Open Source Software.</p>

<p>Many people are still investing their own <em>free time</em>, by the way, and
that&rsquo;s how we now have those advanced core technologies to rely our products
on. <strong>Standing on the shoulders of giants</strong>, as they say.</p>

<h2 id="sustainable-open-source">Sustainable Open Source</h2>

<p>More and more Open Source Software contributors are paid to improve Open
Source Software, and most of them to that in the open and actually
contribute to the software that is available to everybody. That&rsquo;s the right
way to do it when handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good">Common
Good</a>.</p>

<p>That said, with the rise of Cloud based computing, more and more people are
also paid to improve Open Source Software without contributing their
improvements back to the communities. That can been seen as a loop hole in
the license terms, or a plain refusal to understand the rules. Most
importantly, it&rsquo;s all about taking for yourself what was freely offered to
be shared with you.</p>

<p>Open Source Software nowadays is mainly maintained in one of those possible
organisations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Open Source Editors</p>

<p>Some Open Source Software are now developed, maintained and released by
commercial editors for whom it makes sense to offer their solution under
FLOSS licencing.</p></li>

<li><p>Independant Communities</p>

<p>Most Open Source Software projects don&rsquo;t have an enterprise editing
them. Instead a community of individual contributors are working on the
project, either as part as their daily job or most often, on their <em>free
time</em>, because they like the project.</p></li>

<li><p>Single Person Projects</p>

<p>And a huge number of smaller software projects are still taken care of
by a single individual who is devoted to his project, for some reason or
another.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For some projects, the sustainability isn&rsquo;t much of a concern, because of a
very small and motivated user group, who will either find another solution
or learn how to maintain the software if needed. That&rsquo;s mainly for software
you would use as a hobby.</p>

<p>For other projects though, I&rsquo;d say as soon as when the project is used in an
enterprise setting, then ensuring a mid to long term sustainability is
crucial to the project users. Because now an enterprise business depend on
the availability of some external software.</p>

<p>As an enterprise using Open Source Software, you should learn enough about
the project&rsquo;s organisation to assess if it&rsquo;s reliable for you to use it.
When it&rsquo;s not, then you have two ways to make the software reliable for you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Contribute time to the software</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s as easy as allowing proper paid time to your staff to contribute
to the Open Source Software you&rsquo;re using, in particular when the project
does not have the backing of a professional editor behind it.</p></li>

<li><p>Contribute money to the software</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t have your staff devote time to learn the project&rsquo;s code and
how to contribute to it, then you need to make it so that the project is
in a good position to do it themselves when you need them to. That means
contributing money to the project so that they are able to pay for other
hacker&rsquo;s time — after all time is money, and you&rsquo;re not willing to put
time on the table, so put money on it, to much the same effect, right?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="open-source-editors-business-models">Open Source Editors Business Models</h2>

<figure class="right"><a href="https://systematic-paris-region.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/LivretBleu_ModelesEconomiques_GT-LogicielLibre_Systematic.pdf">
    <img src="/img/Mod%c3%a8les-%c3%a9conomiques-200x320.jpg"/> </a>
</figure>


<p>When an Open Source project is edited by a professional editor, then we can
observe a short list of business models that are often used. The French free
software work group for research and development investments
<a href="https://systematic-paris-region.org/fr/groupe-thematique-logiciel-libre/">Systematic</a>
has published a paper about those business models.</p>

<p>The most common open source business models for software editors are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Foundations</p>

<p>Foundations typically involve several companies working together on the
same software, in order to lower their R&amp;D costs. They&rsquo;re funded by a
group of enterprises who would each need to maintain the same source
base anyway.</p></li>

<li><p>Double Licencing</p>

<p>The software is available either as under FLOSS license terms, using
either the GPL or the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.en.html">Affero GPL
license</a>, or under
a prorietary license for those users who don&rsquo;t want to publish their own
software as a FLOSS project. Revenues from selling proprietary licenses
allows to invest in the FLOSS version of the software.</p></li>

<li><p>Open Core</p>

<p>The core of a product is Open Source and available under FLOSS licencing
terms, and the editor also builds a proprietary product on-top of the
FLOSS offering, with an additional feature set. Revenues from selling
the extended product allows to invest in the basic FLOSS version.</p></li>

<li><p>Cloud</p>

<p>The editor maintains an Open Source Software and also offers a managed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> solution.
Again, a part of the revenues from the offer is invested back into the
Open Source Software maintenance and improvements.</p></li>

<li><p>Professional Open Source Services</p>

<p>The editor contributes to an Open Source Software and then sells
professional services to its users, such as <em>follow the sun</em> <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>
support that includes upstream bug fixes, specific software builds and
maintenance, on-demand feature development of either extensions or new
features.</p></li>
</ul>

<figure class="right"><a href="https://www.postgresql.org">
    <img src="/img/postgresql-200.jpg"/> </a>
</figure>


<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> itself is very lucky in that
several companies are contributing to the project while entertaining at
least one of the previous business models. That&rsquo;s how PostgreSQL came to be
the world&rsquo;s most advanced open source database and continues to strive at a
very high pace, releasing every year a new major version packed with
improvements, fixes, and new features.</p>

<h2 id="single-person-projects-business-models">Single Person Projects Business Models</h2>

<p>So with people getting paid to contribute to Open Source Software, we could
think that the times or yore are over now, and all is good in our world.</p>

<p>While some highly visible Open Source Projects have the opportunity to
attract direct contributions from smart corporations who understood the
economics behind it, lots of smaller projects, often one-person projects,
are not so lucky, and are actually dependant on the willingness of a single
contributor that handles the project on their <em>free time</em>.</p>

<p>As an enterprise user of such a project, you should wonder how reliable the
situation is, and how to make it actually reliable. As mentioned before,
it&rsquo;s all about you being able to contribute to the project either time,
money, or both.</p>

<p>When developing and maintaining an Open Source Software as a single
individual, how do you make it so that it&rsquo;s possible for you to sustain your
activity?</p>

<p>The least you have to do is make it so that you can pay the bills and
support your family, and maybe it woud be best for the project to benefit
from its maintainer to be able to spend more than just <em>free time</em> on fixing
bugs and improving the software.</p>

<p>Now, how to make that happen is still a gray area, and I think we need to
find better answers than are currently broadly available. I like <em>The
Varnish Moral License</em> idea a lot, and another widely adopted solution
consists of using a <em>crowd funding</em> solution for sponsoring a specific
feature set.</p>

<h2 id="the-varnish-moral-license">The Varnish Moral License</h2>

<p><a href="http://phk.freebsd.dk/VML/">The Varnish Moral License</a> idea from
<a href="http://phk.freebsd.dk/">Poul-Henning Kamp</a> is quite simple. In his own
words, here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Happy varnish users tell me that they want a Varnish Moral License</li>
<li>I send them an invoice from my company</li>
<li>They pay the invoice</li>
<li>I develop Varnish</li>
</ul>

<p>A Moral License to make any kind of big or small money running Varnish on
your website, without feeling the least bit bad about the poor sucker who
created the software, his two kids, his old cat etc etc.</p>

<p>On a more concrete level, the Varnish project gets more of my time and
attention which I use to improve the tool which makes your website work so
well.</p>

<p>Somebody started the rumour that the name was chosen to sneak this expense
into your IT departments budget, along with other software licenses,
rather than put it under your marketing department, where all sponsorships
properly belong and where it would compete with the local soccer team.</p>

<p>That rumour is very possibly true. I might even have started it myself.
Right here even.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="let-s-talk-about-pgloader-now">Let&rsquo;s Talk about pgLoader now</h2>

<p>As you might know already, I am personnaly involved in a Single Person Open
Source Software Project: <a href="https://pgloader.io">pgloader</a>. This project
implements loading data into PostgreSQL in a fully automated way, to enable
the following two use cases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Load data from files with automatic error handling.</p></li>

<li><p>Implement <a href="https://pgloader.io/blog/continuous-migration/">Continuous
Migration</a> from your
current database to PostgreSQL.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can imagine, the <a href="https://pgloader.io">pgloader</a> project is mainly
used in enterprise setups, and so we now have a bunch of companies who
depend on my abilities to single-handedly maintain, improve and release the
software.</p>

<figure class="right"><a href="https://www.citusdata.com">
    <img src="/img/static-animated-citus.200.png"/> </a>
</figure>


<p>On a personal level, I&rsquo;m lucky enough to get paid to work on an awesome
PostgreSQL Extension — check it out at <a href="https://www.citusdata.com">Citus
Data</a>, the Worry-Free Postgres for SaaS.</p>

<p>This is a classic Open Source paradox: my contributions to PostgreSQL allow
me to have a very good job at a great company, and I also have a bunch of
projects I have started along the years and that I maintain on my own. Some
of those projects certainly deserve more attention that what I can offer on
my <em>free time</em>. Those projects include <a href="https://pgloader.io">pgloader</a> of
course, and also the PostgreSQL <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/prefix">prefix</a>
extension that I know is used in production in several telecom companies, or
the <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/pgextwlist">PostgreSQL Extension White
Listing</a> that is used in production
at several PostgreSQL SaaS providers, and which should now be deprecated by
the more ambitious project
<a href="https://github.com/dimitri/pginstall">pginstall</a>… which never took off
because I couldn&rsquo;t make it easy enough to deploy, basically.</p>

<p>What I would like to achieve is an organisation where enterprises that are
using <a href="https://pgloader.io">pgloader</a> can help sustain the project in the
mid to long term. Contributing time to the project is already easy, but
seldom happens. After all pgloader is not an infrastructure level project,
it&rsquo;s more like a background job that you script around then mostly forget
about. So if the product works well enough to solve your immediate problem,
that&rsquo;s good, and now you&rsquo;re already doing something else.</p>

<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have to contribute to pgloader in order to successfully use
it, then why would you bother investing time on the project? While that&rsquo;s
understandable, it leaves the whole idea of the project being sustainable
unanswered.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been setting up funding solutions for the project. The idea
is that I could then hire fellow Open Source Hackers to work on the project
with me and improve it, fix bugs, develop new features. We have a long list
of improvements to make to the project, and I often talk with people from
different companies who would like to see them happening.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t know anyone who would hack Oracle™ support into
<a href="https://pgloader.io">pgloader</a> on their own <em>free time</em> so that some big
companies can now easily migrate their legacy systems to PostgreSQL,
cancelling huge amounts of license fees in the making. That said, I know
several Common Lisp hackers who are for hire and would be happy to be paid
to contribute to enterprise grade Open Source Software solutions…</p>

<h2 id="the-pgloader-moral-license">The pgLoader Moral License</h2>

<p>As I really like <a href="http://phk.freebsd.dk/VML/">The Varnish Moral License</a>
idea, this funding option is of course available to
<a href="https://pgloader.io">pgloader</a>. If you&rsquo;re an enterprise using
<a href="https://pgloader.io">pgloader</a>, consider contributing to the project either
time or money, or both:</p>

<p><script src="https://gumroad.com/js/gumroad-embed.js"></script>
<div class="gumroad-product-embed" data-gumroad-product-id="pgloader"><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/pgloader">Loading&hellip;</a></div></p>

<h2 id="the-pgloader-patrons-membership">The pgloader Patrons Membership</h2>

<figure class="right"><a href="https://pgloader.io">
    <img src="/img/pgloader.320.jpg"/> </a>
</figure>


<p>The pgloader project is fully Open Source and released under <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/license/">The PostgreSQL
License</a> so that anyone can
easily contribute to the project. The whole project management (issue
tracking, feature proposals, etc) happens on the <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader">pgloader github
page</a>, in public.</p>

<p>The pgloader Moral License is a one-off payment — that you can do as many
times as you like. That&rsquo;s a good way to show support for the project and
allow specific feature development, but maybe that&rsquo;s not enough for me to
hire Common Lisp hackers and improve the many little things that need strong
focus and attention in the project.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve also setup a recurring payment solution, the
<a href="https://pgloader.io">pgloader</a> Patrons Membership, that allows a monthly to
yearly commitment to sustain the project improvements in the long term:</p>

<div class="gumroad-product-embed" data-gumroad-product-id="CjXn"><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/CjXn">Loading...</a></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this very long article we&rsquo;ve been talking about how to sustain Open
Source Software development both at the editor level and at the individual
level. While several business models are available for both situations, it&rsquo;s
still not that easy in 2018 for enterprise users of Open Source Software to
ensure that the projects they depend on are sustainable.</p>

<p>We could wait until people like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> or
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com">GitLab</a> integrate Open Source project funding
options, or we can try to solve the problem at our individual scope, one
project at a time, like <a href="http://phk.freebsd.dk/">Poul-Henning Kamp</a> is doing
with <a href="http://phk.freebsd.dk/VML/">The Varnish Moral License</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s build a bridge between companies using Open Source Software and
individual contributors using their own personal time to maintain and
improve innovative solutions!</p>

<p><a href="https://theartofpostgresql.com">The Art of PostgreSQL</a> is the new edition
of my previous release, <em>Mastering PostgreSQL in Application Development</em>.
It contains mostly fixes to the old content, a new title, and a new book
design (PDF and paperback). Content wise, <a href="https://theartofpostgresql.com">The Art of
PostgreSQL</a> also comes with a new whole
chapter about PostgreSQL Extensions.</p>

<p>The new chapter covers extensions such as <code>hstore</code>, <code>pg_trgm</code>, <code>intarray</code>,
<code>earthdistance</code>, <code>ip4r</code>, and <code>hll</code> or HyperLogLog, one of the all times
favorite extensions of <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com">Craig Kerstiens</a>… who
made himself available to answer my questions and share his view of
PostgreSQL Extensions in an interview!</p></div>

<p>PostgreSQL implements a protocol level facility to send the static SQL query
text separately from its dynamic arguments. An SQL injection happens when
the database server is mistakenly led to consider a dynamic argument of a
query as part of the query text. Sending those parts as separate entities
over the protocol means that SQL injection is no longer possible.</p>

system. It&rsquo;s even the world&rsquo;s most advanced open source one of them. As
such, as its core, Postgres solves concurrent access to a set of data and
maintains consistency while allowing concurrent operations.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/tags/concurrency/">PostgreSQL Concurrency</a> series of articles here
we did see several aspects of how to handle concurrent use cases of your
application design with PostgreSQL. The main thing to remember is that a
Database Management System first task is to handle concurrency access to the
data for you.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s article is going to address concurrency in the context of updating
data in a batch. This activity is quite common, as soon as your system is
connected to other systems either internally or with external providers.
While it&rsquo;s pretty easy to ingest new data, and easy enough to update data
from an external source when nothing happens in your database, doing the
operation safely with concurrent activity is more complex. Once more though,
PostgreSQL comes with all the tooling you need to handle that situation.</p></div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>In the previous article of the series <a href="/blog/2018/07/modeling-for-concurrency/">Modeling for
Concurrency</a>, we saw how to model
your application for highly concurrent activity. It was a follow-up to the
article entitled <a href="/blog/2018/07/postgresql-concurrency-isolation-and-locking/">PostgreSQL Concurrency: Isolation and
Locking</a>, which
was a primer on PostgreSQL isolation and locking properties and behaviors.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s article takes us a step further and builds on what we did in the
previous articles in our series. After having had all the characters from
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em> tweet their own lines in our
database in <a href="/blog/2018/06/PostgreSQL-DML.md">PostgreSQL Concurrency: Data Modification
Language</a>, and having had them like and
retweet a lot in <a href="/blog/2018/07/postgresql-concurrency-isolation-and-locking/">PostgreSQL Concurrency: Isolation and
Locking</a>, we
saw how to manage concurrent retweets in an efficient way in <a href="/blog/2018/07/computing-and-caching/">Computing and
Caching</a>.</p>

<p>What we did implement in the previous article is a <em>cache</em> system, all with
its necessary <strong>cache invalidation policy</strong>. Sometimes though, the
processing of an <em>event</em> needs to happen within the same transaction where
the event is registered in your system. PostgreSQL makes it possible to
maintain a summary table transactionally thanks to its
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtrigger.html">trigger</a>
support. Today, we&rsquo;re going to dive in how to maintain a summary table with
triggers, and its impact on concurrency.</p></div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>Let&rsquo;s continue to dive in PostgreSQL Concurrency. In the previous article of
the series, <a href="/blog/2018/07/modeling-for-concurrency/">Modeling for
Concurrency</a>, we saw how to model
your application for highly concurrent activity. It was a follow-up to the
article entitled <a href="/blog/2018/07/postgresql-concurrency-isolation-and-locking/">PostgreSQL Concurrency: Isolation and
Locking</a>, which
was a primer on PostgreSQL isolation and locking properties and behaviors.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s article takes us a step further and builds on what we did in the
previous articles in our series. After having had all the characters from
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em> tweet their own lines in our
database in <a href="/blog/2018/06/PostgreSQL-DML.md">PostgreSQL Concurrency: Data Modification
Language</a>, and having had them like a
retweet a lot in <a href="/blog/2018/07/postgresql-concurrency-isolation-and-locking/">PostgreSQL Concurrency: Isolation and
Locking</a>, it&rsquo;s
time to think about how to display our counters in an efficient way.</p>

<p>In this article, we&rsquo;re going to think about when we should compute results
and when we should cache them for instant retrieval, all within the SQL
tooling. The SQL tooling for handling cache is a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-creatematerializedview.html">MATERIALIZED
VIEW</a>,
and it comes with <strong>cache invalidation</strong> routines, of course.</p></div>

<p>Today&rsquo;s article takes us a step further and builds on what we did last week,
in particular the database modeling for a <em>tweet</em> like application. After

tweet their own lines in our database in <a href="/blog/2018/06/PostgreSQL-DML.md">PostgreSQL Concurrency: Data
Modification Language</a>, it&rsquo;s time for them
to do some actions on the tweets: likes and retweet.</p>

<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re going to put concurrency to the test, so we&rsquo;re going to
have to handle very very popular tweets from the play!</p></div>
